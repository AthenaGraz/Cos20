Heinz Wittenbrink suggests in his lecture to get to grips with the basics of coding - content people need to understand how programming works at its core.

Black screens on which many small white, green, yellow or red characters flicker. Numbers, angle brackets, commas are displayed. For many, it is a big question mark what exactly programmers and software developers have in front of them when they are writing code. Most of the time it is shyness or perplexity that prevents one from asking more questions. Or one acts according to the motto: Don't saddle yourself with something you don't know what to do with anyway.



Yet the programming shortcuts in the background are the be-all and end-all of every website. Without programming, nothing works on the web. And even if people who publish texts and images on the internet rarely actually come into contact with the codes, for example the programming language HTML, it is worth taking a look at them, according to the lecture "Digital Publication Platforms".

## Exchange ideas with technical staff

After all, part of the job profile of a content strategist is to commission and accompany the development of content management systems, to design applications or at least to supervise them and adapt them for one's own use. Often it is just a matter of making small adjustments. Especially then, one should be able to exchange ideas with the technicians and know which vocabulary is best to use. After all, you want to be understood with your wishes and goals.



At least that is the argument of Heinz Wittenbrink, long-time head of the [Master's programme in Content Strategy at the FH Joanneum](https://www.fh-joanneum.at/content-strategie-und-digitale-kommunikation/master/) and currently a lecturer. In his lecture, he shows the most important basics of programming - and wants one thing above all: for the students to get to grips with it themselves. They are supposed to create a small website project themselves, which doesn't have to be so much about the content. But the website should contain what can be done with relatively little effort. Text, headlines, subtitles, pictures, captions, links to each other and links to external sites. A real structure. You can find plenty of suggestions on how best to get started on the web. But more on that later.

First, it is worth taking a look at Wittenbrink's curriculum vitae to understand how a content person can develop a passion for the web and publishing there. Wittenbrink started his early career in book publishing. As far as publishing on the internet is concerned, he is considered an early adopter. He experimented in this field as early as the 1990s and implemented his first projects. For example, in the conception of the encyclopaedic platform Wissen.de or in the development of a B2B portal in the field of electronic publishing for Bertelsmann.

At that time, there were neither ready-made online editorial systems nor simple, easy-to-understand instructions on how to proceed. Wittenbrink probably had to learn the basics of programming in order to do justice to his tasks. And he obviously recognised the added value in it: that good things can come about when content creators can exchange ideas with technicians on an equal footing.

## Useful guides

Today, the web is full of guides that quickly teach you HTML. The page [develpoper.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) recommended by Wittenbrink shows how a typical HTML page and an HTML element is structured, what the head and metadata is about. It also shows how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.

Why structuring the text is important is explained [on another page there](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals): Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings, to begin with. If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely get frustrated and go somewhere else.

## Important for search engines

The role of search engines also weighs heavily and must be taken into account when coding HTML: Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).


German-language sources for self-study of the code also exist. The aim of [selfhtml.org](https://www.selfhtml.org/) is to provide documentation on HTML and related technologies. It is intended to introduce beginners to the creation of websites in accordance with the current state of the art, but also to serve as a reliable reference work for advanced users and professionals. Clearly arranged in a wiki, those interested will find everything they are looking for on HTML. Hardly any question remains unanswered. You can work your way from one HTML term to the next via numerous links.

Very basic in design, but no less in-depth in content, is the site [html.spec.whatwg.org](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), which is constantly updated.

And when you're through with the instructions? Then hopefully the following sentence by Wittenbrink applies: "You have to be able to understand the core of HTML‚Äù.Then, he says, it is "no witchcraft" to control what may be the responsibility of other members of an organisation or company - to handle the technical stuff in the background. Because, as is often the case, you can't become an expert in everything. But a little control is always helpful and being able to have a say doesn't hurt anyway.
